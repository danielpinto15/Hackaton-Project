            <p>Say it with me: having curly hair is an honor and privilege. Then, repeat it one more time. Solange, who so eloquently
            reminded us that our curls are our crown with her heartfelt lyrics featured in 2016 single "Don't Touch My Hair",
            further reaffirmed that we should be proud to treat our hair like royalty. With that being said, natural hair is still a
            lot of work, and requires top-notch products to keep curls flourishing. No one curl is the same, and it's important to
            know what works for you and the universal hair rules that apply to every single hair type.
            
            Thankfully, there hasn't been a shortage of amazing products that cater to natural hair. There's literally something for
            everything. Considering that the curly styling options are endless, your product shelf has to be in alignment. And as
            hard as it is, don't be afraid to try something new! Testing new products will only allow you to get to know your curls
            betterâ€”embrace the experiment, even if the results don't always add up. From sophisticated styling creams to next-level
            leave-in treatments, ahead find the very best curl products naturalistas should know about.</p>
